Caltech Honor Code: The Honor System is the guiding principle of conduct for the Caltech community. This principle is simply stated: "No one shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community." The Honor System is very important at Caltech and is designed to protect all members of the Caltech community.

Template and instructor-given code are removed as much as possible. Credits are given to all template/starter code made available by the course.
